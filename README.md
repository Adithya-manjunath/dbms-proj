SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

To be used efficiently, all computer software needs certain hardware components or other software
resources to be present on a computer. These prerequisites are known as system requirements and are
often used as a guideline as opposed to an absolute rule. Most software defines two sets of system
requirements: minimum and recommended. With increasing demand for higher processing power and
resources in newer versions of software, system requirements tend to increase over time.
Since the Post Match Stat Analysis for MOBA project is designed to run on the web, the basic system
requirements include connectivity to the internet and supporting tools such as browsers. Given below
is a list of such tools and technologies used.
